## Summary

As researchers and data practitioners, we need to consider how to make decisions as individuals and on teams for how we collect, manage, and use the datasets we work with.

In this chapter, we give an overview of data governance frameworks and practices for different contexts such as machine learning. 
We will provide guidance and real-world examples of tools for how different teams have approached activities within the data governance umbrella such as
data collection and data processing, which can support the adoption of practices for reproducible and responsible work with data.

In this chapter we will cover:

## Motivation

Teams working with or managing datasets can benefit from frameworks and best practices for making decisions about the data.
To address the array of challenges associated with managing data, data governance tools and frameworks can support this process and 
afford more rights to individuals who may be the subjects in or creators of the data as well as communities represented in the data.
